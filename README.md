# Windows_Weak_File_perms_Priv_Esc_Enumeration
Windows weak file permissions/priv esc Enumeration using PowerShell

Test and use accordingly. This script will enumerate the files/executables on the system you landed with limited shell and possibly find an executable running as Full Control.

You may exploit that service/executable by restarting it and gain priv esc.

#This can be use for attacking and defending (possibly way ahead of attacks ;))
